# 7.7.7.7

Long, long time ago, between the world of darkness and the world of living people, it was built - a line of defense, a trap for dark forces. The Net. But due to the shenanigans of creatures of darkness, cracks are already scattering across it. This battle cannot be won.There is just one chance. You gotta get down to the lair of Darkness and strike evil straight into the heart.

## Bestiary

### Wortor

*"Seems like I've seen this somewhere before..."*

The Worthor is one of the most feared creatures of darkness. It does not take your life, but makes you wandering again and again through the same nooks and crannies of the dungeon, until you gradually lose your mind and lose hope of getting out. It's best not to meet this glowing vortex at all unless you want to spend time going through the same dungeon sections multiple times.

### Rat

*"Oh no! they are everywhere!"*

On leftovers dumped into the sewers, fueled by the evil energy of the Heart of Darkness, these monsters have grown to unimaginable sizes and they are always hungry for fresh food. They will definitely attack you to bite off a piece or, if you're don't have enough luck, to eat you whole. I advise you to avoid them if you can.

### Spider

*"There should be a pun about spider webs and the Web*

The second name of these spiders is death. They will poison you, tear you apart with their mandibles, tangle you in a web. Consider yourself lucky if there is just one old slow spider, but if there are several of them nearby and they are young and fast, you should be careful.

### Grass

*"Worse than paper cut."*

Even the grass in the dungeon can be dangerous. If you accidentally step on it, you will feel how tiny sharp knives stick into your feet. I wonder if it's red by itself or someone has already passed here before me? Thanks Net if you quickly run through it, it will not cut you.

### Plant

*"Good thing they don't smell!"*

What can grow in a dark dungeon without sunlight, among monsters, dangerously close to the center of Darkness? Certainly not daisies. You should not approach these plants, which are more likely to "pick you up" themselves than allow you to come closer to them. Everyone needs something to eat, try not to become their dinner.

### Swinx

*"It's time to remember everything you were taught in school."*

But that probably won't help. Swinks' language is the language of Darkness, his favorite lesson is anatomy, his grades are: A for cunning, A for gloominess, A for philanthropy (mmm, delicious!). If you have to guess his riddles, don't forget about it.
