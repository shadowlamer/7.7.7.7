# 7.7.7.7

Long-long ago, between the world of darkness and the world of living people,
it was built - a line of defense, a trap for dark forces. The Net.
But from the blows of the creatures of darkness, cracks are already scattering across it.
This battle cannot be won. Gotta get down to the lair of Darkness and strike evil 
straight into the heart.
